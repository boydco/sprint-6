max width is great for kind of automating the responsiveness of html items. But it's really only the first step.

Media queries are interesting and essential in this day and age with all the different clients people use to view web pages. I think having a bookmark of all the break point devices is essential and MDN is great for that.

I explored the different frameworks a bit. I think it's beneficial to experiment and play with frameworks to kind of see how other elements work within CSS. As the tutorial said frameworks are no substitute for knowledge of html and css but it can definitely be beneficial when working on multiple projects to be able to jump in and get a quick start if the project doesn't require customized solutions. That being said, I don't think it's a great idea as a budding developer to rely on frameworks at this juncture.
