In terms of accessibility as it relates to my personal website. I want to strive for AA conformance as that seems to be the mainstream level of conformance. I think it's important to recognize the target audience of a website when determining what level of conformance.

I think I'll need to make my personal website readable to screen readers. I won't be using an video or audio content so I don't have to worry about captioning or audio descriptions on my website. It will be all written content and images. So I'll need Alt tags and to describe the content as we've done in previous sprints.



I did research on the laws in the US as that's where I'm from and where I will probably be working. There are a series of gov't acts in the past, most notably the American Disabilities Act and Telecommunications Act that deal with web site accessibility. The acts essentially require telecommunciation products and services to be accessible whenever it is 'readily achievable'.

There is no such thing as compliance for the ADA or telecom act however W3C created an international WCAG that has adopted priority 1 and priority 2 checkpoints as standards for website accessibility. WCAG is just a recommendation so it'll be interesting to see court cases where it was used or if it is in the future.
