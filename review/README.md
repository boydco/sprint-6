Nice work on promises, media, and layout.

For accessibility, check out http://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianagardella/2015/04/02/does-your-website-violate-the-americans-with-disabilities-act/

Also, if you're really interested, you can always get help from the WAI Interest Group mailing list: http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/

You can ask questions on the list (politely) and get answers from the top accessibility experts in the world. It's a tremendous resource.

On Bootstrap, etc., these are great for getting things up and running quickly so you can focus on other learning, such as JavaScript and HTML. But you are right, at some point early on it's good to delve into CSS to see how they work.

Looks like you spent some serious time on the Tic Tac Toe. What did you have trouble with? The app seems to be working, but no `checkForWin` function.

Do try to get back to this and finish it at some point. It may seem easier after the next two sprints.
