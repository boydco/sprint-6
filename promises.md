Two things you must do to keep promises with link is to always use true descriptive text in the anchor text setting an expectation for users where that link will lead. The other is to make the destination page obviously match the anchor link. 

In my own website I will ensure promises are kept by matching anchor link in nav and in-content links lead to pages with corresponding headings. 

Link Rot

In terms of link rot, a few things I'd do to prevent link rot:

1. choose linking text carefully and only use necessary links. Don't accidentally build a link farm.

2. Avoid link-shorteners like bit.ly, etc. because you are dependent on their security and it's not more stable than the underlying URL.

3. When building and maintaining my own website, ensure that when I build a new page put int a 301 redirect from old URL to new URL. 

extra credit. Use a program like screaming frog twice a year to check all the links on a website.
